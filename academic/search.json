    "text": "Abstract\nThe phenomenon of closing civic space has adversely impacted INGO funding. We argue that individual private donors can be important in sustaining the operations of INGOs working in repressive contexts. Individual donors do not use the same performance-based metrics as official aid donors. Rather, trust can be an important component of individual donor support for nonprofits working towards difficult goals. How does trust in charitable organizations influence individuals’ preferences to donate, especially when these groups face crackdown? Using a simulated market for philanthropic donations based on data from a nationally representative sample of individuals in the United States who regularly donate to charity, we find that trust in INGOs matters substantially in shaping donor preferences. Donor profiles with high levels of social trust are likely to donate to INGOs with friendly relationships with host governments. This support holds steady if INGOs face criticism or crackdown. In contrast, donor profiles with lower levels of social trust prefer to donate to organizations that do not face criticism or crackdown abroad. The global crackdown on NGOs may thus possibly sour NGOs’ least trusting individual donors. Our findings have practical implications for INGOs raising funds from individuals amid closing civic space."

    "text": "Abstract\nState restrictions on non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have become increasingly pervasive across the globe. While this crackdown has been shown to have a negative impact on public funding flows, we know little about how it impacts private philanthropy. How does information about crackdown abroad, as well as organizational attributes of nonprofits affect individual donors’ willingness to donate internationally? Using a survey experiment, we find that learning about repressive NGO environments increases generosity in that already-likely donors are willing to donate substantially more to legally besieged nonprofits. This generosity persists when mediated by two organizational-level heuristics: NGO issue areas and main funding sources. We discuss the implications of our results on how nonprofits can use different framing appeals to increase fundraising at a time when traditional public donor funding to such organizations is decreasing."

    "text": "Abstract\nAn increasing number of countries have recently cracked down on non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Much of this crackdown is sanctioned by law and represents a bureaucratic form of repression that could indicate more severe human rights abuses in the future. This is especially the case for democracies, which unlike autocracies, may not aggressively attack civic space. We explore if crackdowns on NGOs predict broader human rights repression. Anti-NGO laws are among the most subtle means of repression and attract lesser domestic and international condemnation compared to the use of violence. Using original data on NGO repression, we test whether NGO crackdown is a predictor of political terror, and violations of physical integrity rights and civil liberties. We find that while de jure anti-NGO laws provide little information in predicting future repression, their patterns of implementation—or de facto civil society repression—predicts worsening respect for physical integrity rights and civil liberties."

    "text": "Abstract\nA wave of legislative and regulatory crackdown on international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) has constricted the legal environment for foreign advocacy groups interested in influencing domestic and global policy. Although the legal space for advocacy is shrinking, many INGOs have continued their work and found creative ways to adapt to these restrictions, sometimes even reshaping the regulatory environments of their target countries in their favor. In this article, I explore what enables INGOs to cope with and reshape their regulatory environments. I bridge international relations and interest group literatures to examine the interaction between INGO resource configurations and institutional arrangements. I argue that specific resource and managerial characteristics provide organizations with ‘programmatic flexibility’ that enables groups to adjust their strategies without changing their core mission. I illustrate and test this argument with case studies of Article 19 and AMERA International and demonstrate how organizations with high programmatic flexibility can navigate regulations and shape policy in their target country, while those without this flexibility are shut out of policy discussions and often the target country itself. I conclude by exploring how the interaction between internal characteristics and institutional environments shape and constrain the effects of interest groups in global governance."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nEcological theorists have generated several yet unresolved disputes that try to untangle the difficulty in understanding the nature of complex ecological communities. In this paper, we combine two recent theoretical approaches that used together suggest a promising way to consider how evolutionary and ecological processes may be used to frame a general theory of community ecology and its functional stability. First, we consider the theoretical proposal by Mark Vellend (2016) to focus on a small set of higher-level evolutionary and ecological processes that act on species within an ecological community. These processes provide a basis for ecological theory similar to the way in which theoretical population genetics has focused on a small set of mathematical descriptions to undergird its theory. Second, we explore ideas that might be applied to ecosystem functioning developed by Alvaro Moreno and Matteo Mossio’s (2015) work on how biologically autonomous systems emerge from closure of relevant constraints. To explore the possibility that combining these two ideas may provide a more general theoretical understanding of ecological communities, we have developed a stochastic, agent-based model, with agents representing species, that explores the potential of using evolutionary and ecological processes as a constraint on the flow of species through an ecosystem. We explore how these ideas help illuminate aspects of stability found in many ecological communities. These agent-based modeling results provide in-principle arguments that suggest that constraint closure, using evolutionary and ecological processes, explains general features of ecological communities. In particular, we find that our model suggests a perspective useful in explaining repeated patterns of stability in ecological evenness, species turnover, species richness, and in measures of fitness."

Finally, I conclude with suggestions for future research on NGOs and their relationship with and role in authoritarian regimes."

This article presents a simple conceptual framework to describe a vast array of estimands which are reported under imprecise and inconsistent terminology across disciplines: predictions, marginal predictions, marginal means, marginal effects, conditional effects, slopes, contrasts, risk ratios, etc. We introduce marginaleffects, an R package which offers a simple and powerful interface to compute all of those quantites, and to conduct hypothesis tests on them. marginaleffects is lightweight; extensible; it works well in combination with other R packages; and it supports over 70 classes of models, including Generalized Linear, Generalized Additive, Mixed Effects, and Bayesian models."

We use a conjoint survey experiment to argue that domestic political environments of NGO host countries influence preferences of private donors and that legal crackdowns on NGOs serve as a heuristic of organizational deservingness."

    "text": "Abstract\nIn an effort to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, most governments have imposed restrictions on movement, association, and other civic freedoms in the interest of public health. In many cases, such as New Zealand, these emergency measures have been temporary and respect for human rights has returned to normal. In many other instances, however, governments have used these restrictions to suppress opposition and more permanently restrict civic space. Systematically measuring the consequences of COVID restrictions, however, is a difficult task. We will examine two possible quantitative measures of the relationship between of COVID restrictions and civil society space. First, we will use the Variety of Democracy project’s newly released Pandemic Violations of Democratic Standards Index to explore if and how civil society restrictions predict pandemic backsliding. Second, while many countries sign international human rights treaties that ostensibly bind states to respect rights, several treaties allow for emergency derogations from these obligations. We will tabulate formal human rights treaty derogations due to the pandemic and explore whether these emergency measures led to lasting declines in associational and human rights. We hope that our exploration of these two measures will provide rich data-based descriptions of the relationship between COVID restrictions and civic space that will allow for more causal work in the future."

    "text": "Abstract\nForeign donors routinely use nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to deliver foreign aid. However, states are increasingly relying on repressive legislation to crack down on NGOs within their borders. How have foreign aid donors responded to this legal crackdown on NGOs? Using original data from all countries that received aid from 1981–2012, we assess the impact of anti-NGO laws on total flows of official foreign aid, the nature of projects funded, and the channels used for distributing this aid. Overall, we find that donors scale back their operations in repressive countries. However, rather than completely withdraw, we find that donors redirect funds within restrictive countries by decreasing funds for politically sensitive issues, and channeling more aid through domestic rather than foreign NGOs. While our findings challenge existing notions of foreign aid running on “autopilot,” they also have worrying implications for Western donors and domestic NGOs working on contentious issues."

    "text": "Abstract\nOver the past decade, international NGOs (INGOs) have become increasingly active in authoritarian regimes as they respond to emergencies, assist with development, or advocate for human rights. Though these services and advocacy can challenge the legitimacy and power of the regime, many autocratic states permit INGO activities and INGOs continue to work in these countries despite the sometimes heavy restrictions on their activities. In my dissertation, I theorize that this relationship between INGOs and autocrats creates a state of amicable contempt, where each party is aware that the other threatens—yet sustains—their existence. Autocrats and INGOs engage in a dance of cost-benefit calculus, each trying to advance their own agenda without upsetting their counterpart. Regimes work to set the optimal level of INGO regulations, maximizing the practical and reputational benefits that INGOs provide and minimizing the potential destabilizing costs of INGO activities. Meanwhile, INGOs work to find the optimal mix of programming within a country that allows them to pursue their principled objectives within the boundaries the regime has set—affecting as much change and providing as many services as possible without risking expulsion from the country. I use evidence from a global survey of international NGOs to define each INGO-related element of the theory of amicable contempt. I find that INGOs are primarily motivated by their core vision and values, but that they have to balance the pursuit of their missions with instrumental concerns such as fundraising, time, staffing, and collaboration. These concerns both limit and enable INGO activities—without substantial instrumental resources and programmatic flexibility, organizations are unable to carry out their mission, while too much emphasis on resource concerns distracts organizations from their core programming and reduces their effectiveness."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe past two decades have been characterized by considerable progress in developing approaches to causal inference in situations where true experimental manipulation is either impractical or impossible. With few exceptions, however, commonly employed techniques in political science have developed largely within the frequentist framework (i.e., Blackwell and Glynn 2018; Imai and Kim 2019; Torres 2020). In this article, we argue that common approaches rest fundamentally upon assumptions that are difficult to defend in many areas of political research and highlight the benefits of quantifying uncertainty in the estimation of causal effects (Gill 1999; Gill and Heuberger 2020; Schrodt 2014; Western and Jackman 1994). Extending the approach to causal inference for cross-sectional time series and panel data under selection on observables introduced by Blackwell and Glynn (2018), we develop a two-step Bayesian approach to the estimation of marginal structural models. We demonstrate our proposed procedure in the context of parametric survival analysis and linear mixed effects models via a simulation study and two empirical examples. Finally, we provide flexible open-source software implementing the proposed method."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nChina’s 2017 Overseas NGO (ONGO) Law is part of a larger global trend of legal restrictions on international NGOs (INGOs). However, the effects of this global crackdown on INGOs have been difficult to measure since there is often divergence between the formal de jure regulations and the de facto implementation of these laws. The enforcement of these laws also depends on the services provided by these organizations. In particular, authoritarian regimes display conflicting attitudes towards claim-making (e.g. advocacy) INGOs versus service-providing (e.g. humanitarian assistance) INGOs. In this paper, we measure the effect of China’s ONGO law on INGO operations since 2017. We test how INGO operational flexibility under the ONGO law is influenced by organizations’ issue areas. We argue that service provision INGOs have greater flexibility and are allowed to work in a larger number of provinces than their claim-making counterparts. China provides an excellent setting for testing our claim—the 2017 ONGO law regulates both claim-making and service-providing NGOs, and ambiguity in the law gives ample room for arbitrary discretion by authorities. We test our argument using multilevel Bayesian models with administrative data from 635 registered representative offices of INGOs registered in China between 2017–2021. Our results speak to the broader literature on closing civic space and provide an empirical illustration of the practical effect of NGO restrictions on global civil society."

    "text": "Abstract\nDiscovering causal relationships and testing theoretical mechanisms is a core endeavor of social science. Randomized experiments have long served as a gold standard for making valid causal inferences, but most of the data social scientists work with is observational and non-experimental. However, with newer methodological developments in economics, political science, epidemiology, and other disciplines, an increasing number of studies in social science make causal claims with observational data. As a newer interdisciplinary field, however, nonprofit studies has lagged behind other disciplines in its use of observational causal inference. In this article, we present a hands-on introduction and guide to design-based observational causal inference methods. We first review and categorize all studies making causal claims in top nonprofit studies journals over the past decade to illustrate the field’s current of experimental and observational approaches to causal inference. We then introduce a framework for modeling and identifying causal processes using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and provide a walk-through of the assumptions and procedures for making inferences with a range of different methods, including matching, inverse probability weighting, difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity designs, and instrumental variables. We illustrate each approach with synthetic and empirical examples and provide sample R and Stata code for implementing these methods. We conclude by encouraging scholars and practitioners to make more careful and explicit causal claims in their observational empirical research, collectively developing and improving quantitative work in the broader field of nonprofit studies."
