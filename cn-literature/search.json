    "text": "1.1 人性是發展的\n全書似乎是先有「人性是發展的」總論點基調，再去找材料套進去這條一以貫之的總線索，邏輯看起來一貫明了，論證卻時常缺乏說服力。因邏輯自足，全書文風顯得酣暢大氣，某些段落有排山倒海之勢，因而頗見作者性情；也因此導致寫作時語言表述方面瑕疵不少。讀者容易掉進作者的「邏輯圈套」而走火入魔，本書應是文學史學習的「另類參考課本」。\nBefore landing into the CLI let us consider the Unix concept. The first question that comes in this section is : what is Unix ? It simply is an :operating system (OS). In other words, it is a set of programs that inter-operate with each other to let you communicate with the machine. A very important variant (or clone) of Unix is the very well known OS :Linux, which was created by :Linus Torvalds from scratch. The most important idea behind Unix based systems is the idea that we can use it to access information and hardware programmatically. Other main feature from Unix-like OS systems is the fact that data is usually stored as text files and the interface by which users communicate with the machine is also text-based (TUI : text user interface as opposed to GUI, graphic user interface).\n\n\nFigure 1.1: A terminal app displaying common features of the command line interface\n\n\nAlmost every computer has a way to interact with or access to the inner elements of the computer. Such interface is called the the command-line-interface Fig. 1.1.\n\n1.1.1 File paths\nPrograms, files and directories on every machine (with Unix-like OS) display hierarchical paths (routes), starting out from the root (represented by the back-slash character /). The root represents the beginning of all the software installed in the machine. And many other files are nested from there forming a tree-like structure for the paths Fig. 1.2\n\n\nFigure 1.2: A terminal displaying tree-like structure of the programs in a machine with macOS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can inspect the paths of a nested directory tree using tree command in you cli :\ntree -d -L 1\n\nThere are basically two ways to explore or navigate your file system. If you always represent it from the root, then you are presenting an absolute path. For instance the absolute path to my desktop is (/Users/camilogarcia/Desktop).\n\n1.1.2 Basic Unix commands\nGiven that the vast majority of file systems are organized in file paths, the first question when starting with the CLI is “Where am I ?”. So Unix tool system is equipped with a bunch of commands but its basic ones are pretty much oriented to answer that question and navigating this text-based interface of files. The following three commands (pwd, cd, ls) will help you conquer the CLI.\n\n1.1.2.1 Printing your working directory\nTo know where you are you can see your current location, that is to print your working directory using the pwd command.\npwd\n\n1.1.2.2 Change to other directory\ncd test-dir\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nSome basic arguments to navigate across your terminal :\ncd .. # change backwards\ncd ~  # change to the home\ncd /  # change to the root\ncd -  # change to previous dir\n\n\n1.1.2.3 Listing files\nls \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can navigate your executed commands by typing  or .\n\n\n1.1.2.4 Making new directories\nmkdir test-dir\n\n1.1.2.5 Creating a file\nA simple command to create any file inside your terminal is touch it just create a file, but do not allow any editing.\ntouch new-file.txt\nThe new-file.txt is empty and created on your current location unless you assign another path when creating it. We suggest to take a look at Allison Horst illustrations, especially on how to name files depending on the case see Fig. 1.3\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Different conventions for naming files or directories as a good computational practice. Such as de the kebab-case or the UpperCammelCase. Illustration by Allison Horst\n\n\n\n1.1.2.6 Printing files or inputs\ncat new-file.txt\nsome\nlines\nthat\nwere\nwritten\n\necho \"This will be printed\"\n\nThis will be printed\n\n\n\n1.1.2.7 Removing files or directories\nrm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen having a long command, it becomes practically to go to the beginning or to the end of it. To do so you can use the key combination Ctrl + A and Ctrl + E respectively.\n\nrmdir\n\n1.1.3 Anatomy of a command\nThere is still many conventions by which the parts of a command line might be called, yet a very standard convention is presented in Fig. 1.4\n\n\nFigure 1.4: A simple command and a convention to call its main components\n\n\nSome other for instance also tend to call the option as flag. This conventions are powerful because almost any command line interface display this structure (complex one add some other features and simple one tend to lack subcommands).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\n\n\nBacterial defense mechanisms to avoid bacteriophage infections are abundant. One of these is the :restriction-modification system (RM-System), which works by targeting a specific sites called motifs, shared by the phage and bacteria, with methylations. Motifs are commonly represented as a :sequence logo which is a probabilistic representation of the nucleotides at each position. The challenge consists of finding the number of times the motif from Fig. 1.5 appears on B. tequilensis EA-CB0015 genome using a command. Assume that probabilities are equal when multiple bases appeared at one site.\n\n\nFigure 1.5: A RM-system motif logo\n\n\nBefore diving into an :answer take your time to think and solve it by your own."

Many RE are directed to specific DNA motifs normally palindromic. There are mainly three types according to it digestive mechanism. RE have been widely used in molecular biotechnology because its specificity and versatility to carry out different experiments.\nOne of the main uses of RE is to generate a pattern of restricted fragments from different organisms so that samples of organisms, sequences or genes could be distinguished, as long as they display differences in the number of recognition motifs. This is normally done in the lab, where an RE is mixed with a DNA sample and later an :electrophoresis gel is run to see a separation pattern according to the fragments size.\nProfessor Javier has sequenced the genome of a sampled SARS-CoV2 and want to see the band pattern that the genome would display if it were digested with the RE EcoRV. He has asked you to help him with this problem. The expected output is a text file with the sizes of the fragments, where the size is the number of nucleotides of each fragment.\n\n\n\nFor more explanations on the basic commands in the command line we suggest to visit the first chapters of Computing skills for biologist from Allesina & Wilmes (2019)\nA list of reading for this section :\nDudley & Butte (2009)\nPerkel et al.

Several VCSs have been created but the most popular is git. It is characterized by being a distributed VCS, which means that changes history are recorded locally (whether in a user laptop or user account) in contrast to other centralized VCSs that changes are saved on a shared machine or server.\nSo, why bother to learn a VCS in bioinformatics ? Well there are many reasons, but to highlight some of them : i) Since VCSs allow you to record changes, you can always trace back the steps made in ana analysis, which is nice for the reproducibility of your work. ii) a system like git could be coupled with a shared-centralized server as it is GitHub (we’ll talk about it later and then one could share and collaborate, expanding the extent of your research and iii) following the structures and command from git its at first overwhelming and demands consistency and order, then when scaling a project it will payoff this stepping curve of learning by keeping the efficiency of your work."

More configurations are available, for instance the preferred editor to work with and so on, you can explore by asking for help git config --help or git config --list.\n\n2.2.1 The basics\nThere are at least six basic commands. Three of them allow recording local changes (git init, git add and git commit) and the other three help you to inspect the state of the changes (git status, git diff and git log), we will dive into the detail in the following lines. So, to start recording changes in a directory you must initialize the directory (which will now be called repository) using git init.

    "text": "2.3 Exploring GitHub\nAs mention before, one of the great advantages that git can later achieve is to collaborate. However, to get into that a sharable server must allow users to have a common ground, and this is what GitHub allow. GitHub is a web platform where the local repositories become public and any user can access to the controlled versions of an image of your repo. The famous pet is the octocat Fig. 2.1\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: The octocat from GitHub\n\nTo enable the communication with a remote repo, git has encoded many specific commands, once the repos are cloned a simple workflow from the own local and remote repos is made possible thanks to two simple commands git push and git pull.\nThere a several ways to starting out a remote project, whether it starts from a local folder or whether it starts from a remote repo. The second strategy is sometimes easier as you just need to later git clone the remote into a local folder. To do so every repo has its own code-icon  to later copy the repo link and later hit git clone &lt;https...&gt; on the desired folder. Now you got a linked copy of the remote on your machine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nBut before working on a remote and pushing your first commits, it is common to find an error regarding the remote branch (also called origin). There are several ways to avoid this caveat, but a very anticipated way is to configure git\n\ngit config --global push.autoSetupRemote true\n\nThis will save you from every time typing git push --set-upstream origin &lt;main&gt; when working on a new remote repo.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: The cloning workflow in brief\n\n\nCloning is therefore the process of creating a local copy of remote repository, that is a machine version of the remote repo, later all the common local workflow is carried out normally Fig. 2.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you want to keep a file out of synchronization git provides a simple way to do so by creating a .gitignore file having the the paths to the files to keep in your local machine\n\n\n2.3.1 Forking and collaborate\nBasic collaboration on an open repository is a three-step process. First you need to fork the repo, this will create a mirror copy of the repo in your GitHub profile. In a second step, a simple clone of the repo will generate a copy of the forked repo on your local machine, so you can freely work and make your mistakes and push them to your forked repo that belongs to your account. In a third step, once they are on the remote repo you will have to create a pull request (PR), as its name suggest : you are asking the owners of the original to consider your changes Fig. 2.3.\n\n\nFigure 2.3: A common collaborative workflow from GitHub, using fork, clone and pull requests\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Branching and merging"

Although this might not be the first property or molecule to ever exist (see the :origin of life), the innovation of organisms to pack information of previous events became so advantageous that almost any form of living organism has this property : that is DNA.\n\n\nFigure 4.1: The different scales of information packed in a biological fashion.

It is of course governed by the physicochemical properties of the atoms, therefore DNA is a physicochemical entity. But those common bricks have also a very beautiful emergent property that comes out from their order (mainly), and that is to keep the instructions that build the organism from which it belongs. These instructions are nothing else than information, which also follow some informational rules.

    "text": "4.8 Retrieving data from NCBI\nInforation or databases inside the NCBI comes in many different ways. Perhaps the most used file format in bioinformatics is the FASTA format. It is a very simple format that consist of two lines, the header which is basically noted by starting with the &gt; symbol and is always preceding the sequence, that is present in the second line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n FASTA\n\n\n\n&gt;sequence\nATCCCTAGCTAGCTCGCTATCGATCATCCCTAGCTAGCTCGCTATCGATCATCCCTAGCTAGCTCG...\n\n\n\n4.8.1 The manual way\n\n4.8.2 Entrez direct\nWe first need to install the Entrez Direct command line utilities. This could be done in several ways, one suggested by the manual and a very simple one using conda (mamba).\n\nmamba create -y –n entrez entrez\n\nThis line will create a new conda environment called entrez and will automatically install all dependencies. We later activate the environment with conda activate entrez and then we got the entire Entrez CLI utilities.\nThere are several commands and its function is to interact with the NCBI databases system. It is, however, a very huge set of utilities and commands to cope with at first, so the learning curve is somehow steppe. Here is a way to download the Bacillus tequilensis EA-CB0015 genome with a line of code that interleave three of the main commands of Entrez :\n\nesearch -db assembly -query GCF_012225885.1 |\nelink   -target nucleotide -name assembly_nuccore_refseq | \nefetch  -format fasta &gt; GCF_012225885.1.fasta\n\n\n4.8.3 Simpler download programs\nSince the manual way is clumsy when scaling and automating, and the entrez-direct utilities are somehow hard at first hand, some bioinformaticians have already thought ways to ease users the hard of knowing the NCBI internal database structure and to resume many of the utlities to just a ‘download’ command out from what in entrez is distributed in search, filter, and download commands.\nA very nice command to download genomes is the bit-dl-ncbi-assemblies from Mike Lee, who has also made a remarkable work to bring many bioiformatic knowledge to newcomers. Similarly and quite more robust is the ncbi-genome-download CLI (or abbreviated as ngd) developed by Kai Blin\nWhen navigating the NCBI databases some data is being curated and continuously updated by the execution of annotation tools. The refseq database is precisely the one that is more curated. For the case of genomes the accession number of those that belong to the refseq category are start with GCF ids, whereas the annotated genomes from the genbank category display the GCA ids\nUsing ngd to download a complete genome using the refeseq or genbank accession numbers, would be as easy as :\n\nngd --format fasta --flat-output -A GCF_002055965.1 bacteria\n\nThe one-line will download the refeseq genome of the Bacillus tequilenis EA-CB0015 in a fasta nucleotide format. the --flat-option from the script will handle out extra metadata of the search and will download strictly the data.\nIt is important to highlight that these simpler scripts are focused on genomic information, so that direct downloads of genes, proteins, transcripts, and many other kind of data must be done with entrez or other programs. Some recent efforts have been made to create a more robust CLI to interact with different databases, but in a very easy and intuitive way, such as the gget project. It is more focused on vertebrate databases, but also has a port to NCBI, UniProt and other databases. And is very simple. Here is an example to download all the isoforms in a multi-fasta format of the cancer-related gene BRCA2 in a human genome (GRCh38.p13) :\n\ngget seq -iso -o BRCA2.fasta ENSG00000139618\n\nIt is establishing a connection with the Ensemble database, which is focused on vertebrate genome and transcriptome data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChallenge\n\n\n\nProfessor Camilo is interested on knowing how many complete genomes of Bacillus subtilis are there in the NCBI databases. He asks you later to count the number of features (genes, CDS, ncRNA, rRNA, etc.) in the genome of Bacillus subtilis NCIB 3610 (GCF_002055965.1). And tell you to document each of the steps and how did you end up with the answer. Saving the file with your initials (e.g., CG-activity01.md)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBrown, T. A. (2018). Genomes 4.
