    <h1 id="有朋自遠">有朋自遠</h1>
<p>It is with great pleasure that I begin to pen these memoirs, reflecting upon the many fascinating experiences and adventures that have shaped my life. As I cast my mind back to a recent day in Shanghai, I recall the many challenges and delights that it held.</p>
<p>The day began at the crack of dawn, as I set my sights on mastering the intricacies of the German language. With diligent study and practice, I made significant progress, pushing the boundaries of my knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I turned my attention to my professional courses, eager to deepen my understanding of the complex world of law and business. The lectures were both stimulating and enlightening, filling my mind with new ideas and perspectives.</p>
<p>But the true highlight of the day was the arrival of my dear friend Wei Jun from Canton. With great excitement, I set to work contacting my colleague Zeng Xi, a distinguished legal scholar, to make preparations for a warm and memorable welcome.</p>
<p>Together, we planned every detail, from selecting the finest restaurant to arranging a tour of Shanghai&rsquo;s many attractions. Our efforts were rewarded with an evening of laughter, friendship, and fine dining, as we celebrated Wei Jun&rsquo;s arrival and the joys of life in this vibrant city.</p>
<p>As the night drew to a close, I retired to my studies in German, eager to continue my quest for mastery of this challenging yet rewarding language. As I reflect upon this day and the many others that have come before it, I am struck by the richness and depth of my experiences, and the countless blessings that life has bestowed upon me.</p>
<p>Dear Reader, I hope that these memoirs have provided a glimpse into my world and the many wonders that it holds. Until we meet again, farewell.</p>
<h1 id="刻印看戲">刻印看戲</h1>
<p>I awoke at seven in the morning and after finishing breakfast, I set to work designing a new seal. The process was both meticulous and satisfying as I poured my creative energy into every intricate detail. At eleven o&rsquo;clock, I was greeted by my dear friend and apprentice, Yong Lun, who helped me continue the engraving process with skill and precision.</p>
<p>Despite our best efforts, time seemed to fly by as we worked tirelessly to finish the project before the day was out. After a brief break for lunch, I bid farewell to Yong Lun and saw him off as he departed for his home in Huzhou.</p>
<p>With the rest of the afternoon before me, I decided to focus my attention on learning German, a language that had always fascinated me. The study was both challenging and stimulating, but my determination to master the language drove me forward.</p>
<p>As the sun began to set, I settled in for an evening of entertainment, tuning into the live broadcast of the latest episode of &ldquo;The Adventures of SiLang&rdquo; on the Space Theatre network. The drama was captivating, and I found myself completely immersed in the tale of SiLang and his mother&rsquo;s heroic journey.</p>
<h1 id="和英辭典">和英辭典</h1>
<p>At seven in the morning, I begin my study of German, determined to master the language of western ancestors. With my mind sharp and focused, I dive into the complex grammar and intricate vocabulary, pushing myself to achieve fluency.</p>
<p>At noon, I take a break from my studies to connect with my friend Yong Lun, sharing photos of our recent adventures and discussing our dreams for the future. It&rsquo;s a welcome respite from the rigors of language learning, and I savor the chance to unwind and connect with someone who understands my passions.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I find myself wandering along the bustling  Huzhou Road, drawn to a quaint old bookstore filled with treasures from times gone by. There, I stumble upon a copy of <em>Stalin&rsquo;s Problems of Leninism</em>, a powerful work that speaks to the heart of my political beliefs. I also purchase a copy of the Kenkyusha&rsquo;s English-japanese Dictionary, eager to expand my mastery of the language that has become my second home.</p>
<p>As the evening descends, I return to my German studies, eager to put into practice the lessons I&rsquo;ve learned throughout the day. With each passing moment, I feel myself growing stronger, more confident, more capable of achieving my dreams. And as I close my books and retire for the night, I know that tomorrow will bring even greater challenges and opportunities for growth.</p>
<h1 id="讀蕭公權">讀蕭公權</h1>
<p>At seven o&rsquo;clock, I rose to begin my study of the German language. Midday arrived, and with it, my first foray into the political and philosophical musings of Xiao Gongquan&rsquo;s historical treatise. Intent on prioritizing this book, I resolved to first delve into Western political thought before turning my attention to the China. Come afternoon, I delved into history, and as evening approached, I resumed my study of the German language.</p>
<p>As the days wore on, my mastery of German and Chinese grew apace, but my thirst for knowledge remained unquenched. So it was that one fateful evening, while poring over the works of the great Chinese sage Confucius, I chanced upon a long-forgotten scroll tucked away in a dusty corner of the library.</p>
<p>The scroll was old and worn, its edges frayed with age. But as I unfurled it, my eyes widened in disbelief, for I had stumbled upon a forgotten chapter of history, a tale of war and betrayal that had long since faded into obscurity.</p>
<p>The story spoke of a young warrior, a hero of his people, who had risen up against a tyrant king and fought for freedom and justice. But as the war raged on, the hero&rsquo;s resolve was tested, and he soon found himself embroiled in a deadly game of politics and deceit.</p>
<p>With each passing page, I felt my heart racing, for the story was both thrilling and poignant, a testament to the human spirit and its capacity for greatness. And as I closed the scroll and gazed out into the night, I knew that my journey was far from over, for there were still countless secrets and mysteries waiting to be uncovered, and I was determined to seek them out, no matter where they might lead me.</p>
<h1 id="讀薩拜因">讀薩拜因</h1>
<p>At seven in the morning, I rose to study German, as I did every day. In the afternoon, I continued my linguistic endeavors, striving to perfect my grasp of this complex and nuanced language.</p>
<p>Later in the day, I was visited by my friend Xin Liang, who had returned to school after a long absence. We chatted about our studies and caught up on old times, sharing stories and reminiscing about our youth.</p>
<p>As the evening drew near, I settled in to read a chapter from Prof. George Holland Sabine&rsquo;s seminal work, &ldquo;The Republic.&rdquo; This particular section dealt with the concept of the ideal state, and I found myself engrossed in its thought-provoking ideas and arguments.</p>
<p>As the night wore on, I indulged in a bit of entertainment, tuning in to the live broadcast of &ldquo;Smiling with Tears,&rdquo; a thrilling space opera that had captured the hearts and minds of viewers across the galaxy. As the plot unfolded, I found myself swept up in its gripping narrative and dazzling special effects, marveling at the sheer spectacle of it all. Truly, it was a perfect end to a long and productive day.</p>
<h1 id="秋闈入闈">秋闈入闈</h1>
<p>At seven in the morning, I rose early to continue my study of the German language. As I practiced, I formulated several new principles for effective language learning, which I was eager to put into practice.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I returned to my German studies, fully immersed in the language and its many subtleties. It was then that I received a text message from my dear friend Tianjin Zhang,  announcing his engagement and inviting me to a weekend gathering to celebrate the happy news.</p>
<p>As evening approached, I received word of my score on the national civil service examination: 116.1. While it was still uncertain whether I would be selected for the next stage of the process, I felt a sense of optimism and hopefulness.</p>
<p>Later that night, I received a call from Xian Feilong, an old acquaintance from Xi&rsquo;an. We chatted amiably for half an hour, catching up on old times and reminiscing about our shared experiences. Although I was tempted to discuss the civil service examination with him, I feared that he might mock me if I failed to make the cut, and so I held my tongue. Instead, we made plans to meet up in Xi&rsquo;an, and I looked forward to the opportunity to reconnect with an old friend.</p>
<h1 id="憂喜參半">憂喜參半</h1>
<p>At seven in the morning, I awoke early to continue my German language studies, focusing on both oral and written expression. I practiced reading and reciting aloud, striving to improve my pronunciation and intonation.</p>
<p>During the afternoon, I spent time compiling my notes into an electronic format for easier reference and study. It was then that I received the news that I had made it through to the next stage of the examination process for the Central Translation Bureau. My emotions were mixed, with both joy and anxiety vying for dominance. Nonetheless, I was determined to continue my diligent study of German in preparation for the next round.</p>
<p>Later that evening, I called my mother to report on my progress and share my news. She listened attentively and offered words of encouragement, reminding me of the importance of persistence and dedication in achieving my goals. With her support and my own resolve, I felt more confident and focused than ever before.</p>
<h1 id="投考爲上">投考爲上</h1>
<p>I woke up at eight in the morning and resumed my German language studies, committing myself to the task at hand with renewed vigor and determination. The same went for my afternoon session of language learning.</p>
<p>As I continued to prepare for the next round of the examination, I formulated a set of seven principles to guide me in my approach to the upcoming interview. These included prioritizing my studies above all else, doing everything within my power to succeed, and remaining calm and composed in the face of adversity.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I received a call from the Jiangxi Provincial Security Bureau inquiring about my foreign language proficiency certificates. Though I had not yet obtained any such certification, I decided that it would be unwise to let them know this fact, and so I responded evasively.</p>
<p>Later that evening, I spoke with my grandmother over the phone and informed her that I was considering staying on campus for the upcoming Spring Festival holiday. Although I would miss the traditional family gatherings and feasts, I felt that it was necessary to devote myself fully to my studies and my goals.</p>
<h1 id="寒假留校">寒假留校</h1>
<p>I spent the entire day immersed in my German language studies, determined to make progress and master the language. I focused on grammar, vocabulary, and syntax, delving into complex sentence structures and idiomatic expressions.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, my roommate, Zhao Tianyu, returned to our dormitory, and we made plans to organize a dinner gathering with our other roommates. We decided to cook a simple but satisfying meal and share stories and laughter over food and drinks.</p>
<p>Later that evening, I registered for the winter semester at the university, electing to stay on campus to continue my studies during the holiday break. Although I would miss my family and friends back home, I knew that this was the best decision for my future and my academic pursuits. With a renewed sense of purpose and focus, I continued to push myself to new heights in my studies of the German language.</p>
<h1 id="室友聚餐">室友聚餐</h1>
<p>I spent the entire day engrossed in my studies of the German language, dedicating myself to mastering this beautiful and complex tongue. In the afternoon, I took a break from my studies to sort through and edit some photographs I had taken on my recent travels. It was a refreshing change of pace and reminded me of the beauty and diversity of the world beyond my textbooks and notes.</p>
<p>Later that evening, I joined two of my friends, Xin and Zhao, for dinner at a local restaurant known for its delicious Hunan cuisine. We ordered a variety of dishes, including the famous &ldquo;Xiang La Wang&rdquo; spicy chicken, and enjoyed a lively conversation about our studies, our lives, and our dreams for the future.</p>
<p>After dinner, Xin showed us a documentary he had downloaded about life in North Korea. The footage was both fascinating and harrowing, revealing the stark realities of life under a repressive regime. As we watched, I felt a mix of horror and sadness at the suffering of the people, and gratitude for the freedoms and opportunities I enjoy in my own life. It was a sobering reminder of the preciousness of liberty and the importance of striving for justice and equality in the world.</p>
<h1 id="淘書解壓">淘書解壓</h1>
<p>I woke up at 7 feeling exhausted and couldn&rsquo;t focus on my studies in the morning. In the afternoon, I went to Hu Zhou Road to search for books and came across German language exam questions for the second foreign language, which increased my stress levels. In the evening, I went to Fudan Secondhand Bookstore and bought some books before returning to studying German.</p>
<h1 id="欲速不達">欲速不達</h1>
<p>I woke up at 9 and began studying German. At noon, I borrowed some books to improve my learning strategies for German. In the afternoon, I finished studying the third lesson and felt even more nervous. In the evening, I watched a live broadcast of a play on the &ldquo;Sky Theatre.&rdquo;</p>
<h1 id="同桌訂婚">同桌訂婚</h1>

<h1 id="急火攻心">急火攻心</h1>
<p>I woke up at seven, feeling restless and short of breath, with a slight pain in my chest. I began studying Lesson 6, but I found myself becoming increasingly frustrated and impatient, and decided to skip some of the exercises.</p>
<p>As the day wore on, my anxiety only seemed to intensify, and I struggled to focus on anything for more than a few minutes at a time. Despite my best efforts to distract myself with work and other activities, my mind kept returning to the nagging sense of unease that had taken hold of me.</p>
<p>By the time evening rolled around, I was exhausted both mentally and physically, but still couldn&rsquo;t shake the feeling that something was wrong. I forced myself to continue studying, but every sentence seemed to take twice as long to read and understand as it normally would.</p>
<p>As I lay down to sleep that night, I couldn&rsquo;t help but worry that this sense of unease would continue to haunt me in the days to come.</p>
<h1 id="淘書下棋">淘書下棋</h1>
<p>Stehe um acht auf. In der Bibliothek lerne Lektion 6. AmAbend um fünf in die Buchhandlung gehe. I returned and played chess with Tan Kuanming.</p>
<h1 id="心熱疼痛">心熱疼痛</h1>

<h1 id="夜不成寐">夜不成寐</h1>
<p>I woke up at eight and headed to the language center to study Lesson 7. In the afternoon, I went to the doctor for an electrocardiogram and chest X-ray, both of which came back normal. The doctor refused to prescribe medication and suggested I see a psychiatrist, which I thought was ridiculous. Afterwards, I went to the foreign language bookstore on Hu Zhou Road and bought three German books, including a retelling of Grimm&rsquo;s fairy tales and a German version of Tom Sawyer. That night, I tried to relax, but my anxiety was overwhelming and I couldn&rsquo;t sleep. I realized that the saying &ldquo;haste makes waste&rdquo; was true, and the ancient Chinese sages were not lying to me.</p>
<h1 id="勞其筋骨">勞其筋骨</h1>
<p>I woke up at eight in the morning and went to the Political Science department to attend a master&rsquo;s thesis defense. In the afternoon, I went to the campus hospital, but it was fruitless, so I returned to my dorm to study Lektion 7 of my German textbook. Finally, I finished studying it. Did it strain my muscles and bones?</p>
<h1 id="觀白牡丹">觀白牡丹</h1>
<p>I woke up at eight in the morning and headed to the college to pick up my winter break tickets before diving into Lesson 8. In the afternoon, I indulged in a mesmerizing performance of &ldquo;The Peony Pavilion&rdquo; produced by none other than the legendary Bai Xianyong. As night fell, I had a heartwarming chat with my grandmother and wrapped up my studies for the day, feeling accomplished and content.</p>
<h1 id="惟苦能食">惟苦能食</h1>

<h1 id="首閱曲律">首閱曲律</h1>
<p>I woke up at eight in the morning and studied Lektion 9 at the library. Afterwards, I read through the book &ldquo;曲律&rdquo; (qǔ lǜ) in order. In the afternoon, I went to the library again but found it closed, so I went back to my dorm and watched the &ldquo;Peony Pavilion&rdquo; produced by Bai Xianyong, which was both elegant and humorous. In the evening, I continued studying Lektion 9 but didn&rsquo;t finish it.</p>
